Compilation:
Compile with the default premake4/make combinations.If you get make error, please do a make clean and make again. 
Run with ./A2.
I tested on the machine gl30 in MC3007.

Manual:
The scale limit is set to be between 0 and 5.
The default near plane is 3 and far plane is 20. 
I used the Liang barsky 3d clipping for my clipping.
My multi mouse button down events might not work very well for rotation.
