Compilation:

This is an extended project for assignment, so I keep the program name still be './A4'. Also, I did not make any changes to the cs488 framework.

Using the default premake4/make combination for compling the code as what we did for usual assignments. If you get any target error, please do a 'make clean' then 'make' again.


Run Program:
1. Use ./A4 [lua file] to run the program. The lua files that I created for this project are all in the Assets file. So please run those files through ./A4 Assets/xx.lua
**I tested my program on device gl38 in MC3007
