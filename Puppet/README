Compilation:
1. Use the default premake4/gmake to compile the program in the terminal.
2. Run my puppet using ./A3 Assets/puppet.lua
My puppet.lua file is the one in Assets folder.
I overrided the Assets/puppet.lua file to make my own puppet due to Xcode debug-friendly. New lua file won't be attached to the xcode project target.
3. I tested my program on device gl02 in MC3007

Manual:
My puppet is a Japanese mascot called Kumamon. I also attached a photo of it (A3/kumamon.jpg) just for interest.

Several assumptions:
1. I assumed all the joint transformations are relative to the mouse y motion.
2. Clicking on an unchecked checkbox will check the box while clicking on a checked one will uncheck it. The hot key for the checkbox options will work like this as well. For example, by default, the 'z-buffer' is checked and if I press the 'Z' key, the 'z-buffer' checkbox will be unchecked and z-buffer effect will be closed.
3. The picking color is yellow. Only these below can be picked:
   head (joint about y-axis between -15 and 15)
   leftHand & rightHand (joint about x-axis between 0 and 90)
   leftArm & rightArm (joint about x-axis between -15 and 15)
   leftLeg & rightLeg (joint about x-axis between -30 and 30)
   leftFoot (joint about y-axis between 0 and 70)
   rightFoot (joint about y-axis between -70 and 0)
4. Both resetJoints and resetAll will also clear all the selections(picking).
5. Change to posion/orientation mode will also clear all the selections and when going back to joint mode, selections won't be recovered.
6. The light is always a point light at the eye position.
7. My undo/redo might not work perfectly.

Data Structure changes:
1. add the 'current' field to both m_joint_x and m_joint_y
2. add ChangeJointAngleCommand class in the same name cpp/header file for doing the undo/redo.
3. add picking shader, picking fragment shader to the Assets folder
